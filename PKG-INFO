Description: Mullvad VPN Client Build Instructions
        =====================================
        
        Most of the instructions in this file is for internal use at Mullvad to create installers.
        If you have downloaded our source distribution and read this because you want to be able to install that,
        skip directly to **Installing from source distribution**.
        
        Running unit tests
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        Run all tests
        
        ::
        
            python -m unittest discover [-v] src/
        
        
        To run specific test modules you can provide a path as the last argument to the above command
        
        ::
        
            python -m unittest discover [-v] src/ test_config.py
            python -m unittest discover [-v] src/ "test_*"
        
        You can also run indicidual tests or test cases with the following command, if you are located in the package root, i.e. src
        
        ::
        
            python -m unittest tests.test_config
            python -m unittest tests.test_config.TestSettings
            python -m unittest tests.test_config.TestSettings.test_set
        
        Generate new pot/po files
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py pot
        
        Compile locale directory from po files
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        ::
        
            sudo aptitude install python-setuptools gettext
            python setup.py locale
        
        Source distribution
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        ::
        
            python setup.py sdist
        
        Debian package
        -------------------------------------------------------
        Do the locale steps above and then issue these commands:
        
        ::
        
            sudo aptitude install python-stdeb
            python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb
        
        OSX App
        -------------------------------------------------------
        Download and install the following:
        
        * `wxPython 3.0.2`_ *(wxPython3.0-osx-3.0.2.0-cocoa-py2.7.dmg)*
        
        Install the following Python dependencies using pip::
        
            pip install appdirs ipaddr netifaces psutil
        
        .. _wxPython 3.0.2: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython3.0-osx-3.0.2.0-cocoa-py2.7.dmg
        
        Build Mullvad::
        
            python setup.py locale
            python setup.py py2app
            python setup.py dmg
        
        Troubleshooting on OSX
        ''''''''''''''''''''''
        If the locale step fails for OSX because of a missing "msgfmt" command it might be that you installed gettext from homebrew, which does not link the binaries to the standard path because of collisions with OSX native gettext library, in that case manually add it to your path in the terminal where you build it:
        
        ::
        
            export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/gettext/<version>/bin:$PATH
        
        Windows installer
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        **Setup build environment**
        
        Download and install the following:
        
        * `Python 2.7.10`_ *(python-2.7.10.msi)*
        * `wxPython 3.0`_ *(wxPython3.0-win32-3.0.2.0-py27.exe)*
        * `py2exe 0.6.9`_ *(py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe)*
        * `NSIS 2.46`_ *(nsis-2.46-setup.exe)*
        
        NSIS also needs the following plug-ins to support the Windows installer script.
        They are installed by placing the relevant files in the NSIS/Plugins directory.
        
        * `FindProcDLL`_ *(FindProcDLL.dll)*
        
        Install the following Python dependencies using pip::
        
            pip install appdirs ipaddr netifaces psutil jinja2
        
        **Build the installer**
        
        Generate the locale files (must be done on linux)::
        
            python setup.py locale
        
        Run ``build.bat`` on the Windows build machine
        
        .. _Python 2.7.10: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.10/python-2.7.10.msi
        .. _wxPython 3.0: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpython/wxPython3.0-win32-3.0.2.0-py27.exe
        .. _py2exe 0.6.9: http://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/py2exe-0.6.9.win32-py2.7.exe/download
        .. _NSIS 2.46: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/nsis/nsis-2.46-setup.exe?download
        .. _FindProcDLL: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/FindProcDLL_plug-in
        
        
        Installing from source distribution
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install appdirs ipaddr netifaces psutil
            pip install mullvad-XX.tar.gz  # XX is the version that you have
        
        You also need the other dependencies: openvpn, python-wxgtk3.0 or python-wxgtk2.8, python-gtk2, python-appindicator and resolvconf.
        If you want to use obfsproxy you have to build it yourself from https://git.torproject.org/debian/obfsproxy-legacy.git as the newer versions currently don't work with Mullvad.

        Mullvad 42 (2014-03-26)
        =======================
        - Relevant windows are now frames, not dialogs.
        - UI overhaul. There are now two tabs in the settings window; status and
          settings.
        - The status tab shows time left, connection status, current IP, country and the
          server which you are connected to.
        - You are able to connect, disconnect and quit from the status tab.
        - Settings window is now opened if trying to start mullvad when it's already
          running.
        - Improved shutdown of the client.
        - Always run as python2 to work without change on more system configurations
        - Now correctly removes all IPv6 blocks.
        - Not being able to connect to our master server should less likely result in
          DNS problems when "Stop DNS leaks" is enabled.
        - No more blocking of connection attempts to master through our vpn servers when
          "Block internet on connection failure" is enabled.
        - Various code cleanups and bugfixes.
        
        Linux specific
        --------------
        - Will not try to drop root unless it's possible.
        - Now correctly uses fallback if python-appindicator is not present.
        - Now sets the correct user-id when dropping root.
        - Startup script now works when only su is available.
        
        Mac OS X specific
        -----------------
        - Settings window can now be opened by left-clicking mullvad in the dock.
        - Updated tunnelblick to 3.4beta20 to work correctly on mavericks.
        - Now correctly shows "Stop DNS leaks" as disabled in mavericks since it's not
          working correctly there.
        
        Windows specific
        ----------------
        - Added autostart feature.
        - Forcefully kill openvpn if failing to close with telnet.
        - Now restores multiple DNS servers if "Block DNS leaks" is enabled, not just
          one.
        - Updated openvpn and TAP-drivers to version 2.3.2 and build version 07/02/2012
          respectively.
        - The UI overhaul (described above) should improve the experience on windows 8
          when using modern UI.
